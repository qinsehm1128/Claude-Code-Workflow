# Team Lifecycle v3

Enhanced lifecycle: specification → implementation → testing → review with parallel execution, conditional routing, and dynamic specialist role injection.

## Purpose

Team Lifecycle v3 orchestrates multi-agent software development workflows from initial requirements through implementation, testing, and review. It automatically coordinates specialized agents, manages artifact dependencies, validates quality gates, and dynamically injects expert roles based on task complexity.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Dynamic specialist role injection (security, performance, data, devops, ML)
- Artifact-based validation gating
- Conditional routing based on complexity assessment
- Priority-based task scheduling (P0/P1/P2)
- Quality checkpoints with user feedback loops

## Problem Statement

Complex software development tasks require diverse expertise—security audits, performance optimization, data pipeline design, DevOps configuration, and ML model integration. Coordinating multiple specialized agents manually is error-prone, inefficient, and difficult to scale. Developers face several challenges:

1. **Manual Coordination Overhead**: Tracking dependencies between agents, ensuring artifacts are validated before downstream work begins, and managing parallel execution requires constant human oversight.

2. **Expertise Gaps**: Not all tasks require all specialists. Injecting the right expert roles at the right time based on task complexity and keywords is a manual, subjective process prone to under- or over-staffing.

3. **Quality Assurance Bottlenecks**: Without automated quality gates and validation checkpoints, defects propagate downstream, requiring expensive rework.

4. **Lack of Observability**: Understanding where a multi-agent workflow is stalled, which artifacts are blocking progress, and what actions are needed requires manual inspection of scattered state.

Team Lifecycle v3 solves these problems by providing an event-driven orchestration system that automatically manages agent coordination, artifact validation, specialist injection, and quality checkpoints—turning multi-agent workflows into a repeatable, observable, and scalable process.

## Goals

- **Automated Agent Coordination**: Spawn workers based on task dependencies, manage parallel execution, and handle completion callbacks without manual intervention.
- **Artifact-Based Validation Gating**: Block downstream work until upstream artifacts pass validation, preventing defect propagation.
- **Dynamic Specialist Injection**: Analyze task descriptions and complexity to automatically inject expert roles (security, performance, data, devops, ML) when needed.
- **Conditional Routing**: Route tasks to appropriate implementation strategies (direct, orchestrated, architecture-first) based on quantifiable complexity assessment.
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Execute critical-path tasks (P0) before dependent tasks (P1/P2), optimizing workflow throughput.
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Pause at key milestones for user review, with actionable commands (resume, improve, revise, recheck) to maintain quality.
- **Session Persistence**: Support pause/resume across process restarts, preserving artifact registry and task state.
- **Observability**: Provide clear status reporting, task state visibility, and actionable error messages.

## Non-Goals

- **General-Purpose Workflow Engine**: Team Lifecycle v3 is specialized for software development workflows with agent coordination. It is not a generic DAG executor or distributed job scheduler.
- **Project Management Tool**: The system does not manage backlogs, sprints, or roadmaps. It executes individual tasks with clear requirements.
- **Prescriptive Agent Implementations**: The skill defines role specifications and contracts but does not mandate specific agent implementations or tools.
- **Ticket/PR Management**: State transitions, comments, and PR creation are the responsibility of individual agents using their own tools, not the orchestrator.
- **Approval/Sandbox Policies**: The skill does not enforce specific approval workflows or sandboxing. Implementations may add these based on their trust model.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: The system is event-driven with asynchronous agent execution, not a real-time collaborative editing environment.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
Skill(skill="team-lifecycle-v3", args="<task description>")
```

**Example**:
```
Skill(skill="team-lifecycle-v3", args="Implement user authentication with OAuth2")
```

### Execution Flow

1. **User provides task description** → Coordinator clarifies requirements
2. **Coordinator creates team** → TeamCreate with session folder
3. **Coordinator analyzes complexity** → Injects specialist roles if needed
4. **Coordinator creates task chain** → Based on pipeline selection (spec-only, impl-only, full-lifecycle)
5. **Coordinator spawns first batch** → Workers execute in background
6. **Workers report completion** → SendMessage callback to coordinator
7. **Coordinator advances pipeline** → Spawns next ready tasks
8. **Quality checkpoints** → User can review, improve, or revise
9. **Coordinator generates report** → Final summary and completion action

### User Commands

During execution, you can use these commands:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `check` / `status` | View current execution status |
| `resume` / `continue` | Advance to next step |
| `revise <TASK-ID> [feedback]` | Revise specific task with feedback |
| `feedback <text>` | Provide feedback for targeted revision |
| `recheck` | Re-run quality check |
| `improve [dimension]` | Auto-improve weakest quality dimension |

## Pipeline Options

The coordinator selects the appropriate pipeline based on task requirements:

### Spec-only Pipeline (6 tasks)
```
RESEARCH-001 → DRAFT-001 → DRAFT-002 → DRAFT-003 → DRAFT-004 → QUALITY-001
```
Use for: Documentation, requirements gathering, design work

### Impl-only Pipeline (4 tasks)
```
PLAN-001 → IMPL-001 → TEST-001 + REVIEW-001
```
Use for: Quick implementations with clear requirements

### Full-lifecycle Pipeline (10 tasks)
```
[Spec pipeline] → PLAN-001 → IMPL-001 → TEST-001 + REVIEW-001
```
Use for: Complete feature development from requirements to implementation

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Role Injection

Specialist roles are automatically injected based on keywords in task description:

- **security**, **vulnerability**, **OWASP** → `security-expert`
- **performance**, **optimization**, **bottleneck** → `performance-optimizer`
- **data**, **pipeline**, **ETL**, **schema** → `data-engineer`
- **devops**, **CI/CD**, **deployment**, **docker** → `devops-engineer`
- **ML**, **model**, **training**, **inference** → `ml-engineer`

### Conditional Routing

PLAN-001 assesses complexity and routes to appropriate implementation strategy:

- **Low complexity** (1-2 modules) → Direct implementation
- **Medium complexity** (3-4 modules) → Orchestrated parallel implementation
- **High complexity** (5+ modules) → Architecture design + orchestrated implementation

### Quality Checkpoints

At key milestones, the coordinator pauses for user review:

- **Spec Phase Complete** (QUALITY-001): Review specification quality, choose to proceed, improve, or revise
- **Implementation Complete**: Review code quality and test coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Pipeline stalled | Use `status` to check task states, `resume` to advance |
| Quality gate failed | Use `improve` to auto-improve or `revise <TASK-ID>` to manually fix |
| Wrong specialist injected | Provide clearer keywords in task description |
| Session lost after restart | Use session resume to restore from `.workflow/.team/TLS-*` |

### Error Handling

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Unknown command | Error with available command list |
| Role spec file not found | Error with expected path |
| Artifact validation fails | Block downstream, trigger fix loop |
| Dynamic role injection fails | Log warning, continue with core roles |
| Parallel merge timeout | Report stall, prompt user intervention |
